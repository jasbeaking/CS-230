# CS-230 The Gaming Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, sought to enhance the functionality and expand the reach of their existing Android game, "Draw It or Lost It". They approached CTS with a request to develop a web-based gaming application that could be accessible across multiple platforms. The proposed application would be based on the current "Draw It or Lose It" game, but with additional features to ensure a seamless user experience. The key requirements included the ability to have only one instance of the game in memory at a time, the uniqueness and searchability of game and team names, the inclusion of multiple players per team, and the capability to involve more than one team in a single game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation demonstrates a comprehensive research effort to identify the options that best align with the client's interests. It is crucial to remain impartial when making recommendations, as the client's needs may vary. The research and facts presented convey that the client's best interests are at the heart of the product.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

A software design template (SDT) serves as a valuable tool when developing code, as it provides a structured framework to guide the development process. By clearly defining and agreeing upon the project's requirements, an SDT ensures that the development team utilizes time and resources efficiently, avoiding the need for guesswork regarding the client's desired outcomes. This approach promotes a systematic and organized workflow, ultimately leading to the successful implementation of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Conciseness is valuable in professional communication as it makes the message clearer and more effective. If the author could revise one aspect of the SDT work, they would focus on making the content more concise. By refining the statements to be direct and to the point, the communication between the client and the author would improve. The key lesson from the documentation was the importance of avoiding ambiguity and uncertainty.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were carefully considered in the development of Draw It or Lose It to guarantee a cohesive user experience, intuitive usability, and secure data management. Prioritizing the user's requirements is essential, as they are the ultimate consumers of the product. If the user is dissatisfied with the product or does not have a positive experience, they are unlikely to engage with, purchase, or express interest in other offerings from the same company.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The primary objective in designing the software was to address the client's requirements and furnish the most comprehensive documentation feasible. The documentation of the code will guarantee its adaptability to other applications in the future. This will facilitate comprehension for the developer, whether the author themselves or another, regarding the functionality of each code segment and its potential applications to meet their specific needs.
